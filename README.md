# EduCast
## Problem?
In 2024, university students are increasingly finding it challenging to maintain focus on singular tasks, primarily due to the number of distractions that apps like TikTok, BeReal, or Instagram bring into their lives.

## Why us?
Our group is made up of university students so we more than understand why this is an issue and how we can minimize the cause of this problem. We decided to use a minimalistic UI approach for our application, aiming to mitigate such distractions. “By removing clutter and simplifying the interface, users can easily find what they need, leading to a more efficient and intuitive user experience.” - Dhimas D. Permana.

## Our Goal?
We think that by reducing distractions in apps that shouldn't have them we can improve the attention span of university students. For example, in our design, we decided to use neutral colors such as grey, white, and black, as well as offering a day/night mode feature. We also removed all unnecessary functions of the weather app, limiting the user to just checking the weather. The app also shows the information very clearly with no unnecessary data that average people would not need such as pressure or wind direction.

## How to run
The app requires the user to run npm install react-modal, if not already installed, to be able to run the calendar function. The user must then go to terminal, type in command "npm start", given that Node.js has been installed (using npm start), and then our app "EduCast" will request the users location. Once accept has been selected, weather information about the user's current location will be presented. You may be expected to reset your browsers current location permission for the open localHost site, and then reload the site to be able to accept or deny the location permission request.
