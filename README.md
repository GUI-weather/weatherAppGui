# Problem?
In 2024, university students are increasingly finding it challenging to maintain focus on singular tasks, primarily due to the number of distractions that apps like TikTok, BeReal, or Instagram bring into their lives.

## Why us?
Our group is made up of university students so we more than understand why this is an issue and how we can minimize the cause of this problem. We decided to use a minimalistic UI approach for our application, aiming to mitigate such distractions. “By removing clutter and simplifying the interface, users can easily find what they need, leading to a more efficient and intuitive user experience.” - Dhimas D. Permana.

## Our Goal?
We think that by reducing distractions in apps that shouldn't have them we can improve the attention span of university students. For example, in our design, we decided to use neutral colors such as grey, white, and black, as well as offering a day/night mode feature. We also removed all unnecessary functions of the weather app, limiting the user to just checking the weather. The app also shows the information very clearly with no unnecessary data that average people would not need such as pressure or wind direction.
